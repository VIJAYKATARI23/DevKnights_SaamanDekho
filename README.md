It is the repository to our project for HackThisFall

The website is a Second Hand Marketplace, where users can buy and sell second-hand goods. The website connects buyers and sellers, allowing them to trade used products in a more sustainable way and reducing waste. The website provides a platform for users to list their products, view and purchase items from others, however the payment gateway for transaction is still in progress.
We used Html, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end design of our website. To store the data of users after login/signup we used PHP and MY-Sql.
